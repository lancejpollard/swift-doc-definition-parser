  "desc": "The default formatting behavior. When using positional units, this behavior drops leading zeroes but pads middle and trailing values with zeros as needed. For example, with hours, minutes, and seconds displayed, the value for one hour and 10 seconds is “1:00:10”. For all other unit styles, this behavior drops all units whose values are 0. For example, when days, hours, minutes, and seconds are allowed, the abbreviated version of one hour and 10 seconds is displayed as “1h 10s”.",

The NSThread class posts this notification at most onceâ€”the first time a thread is detached using detachNewThreadSelector(_:toTarget:with:) or the start() method. Subsequent invocations of those methods do not post this notification. Observers of this notification have their notification method invoked in the main thread, not the new thread. The observer notification methods always execute before the new thread begins executing.",

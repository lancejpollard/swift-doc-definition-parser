Right margin is ignored.both. Margins, if any, on both sides are ignored.Instead of specifying margins, you can set this property to true to indicate that both margins should be ignored, or set it to false to ignore neither of the margins. By default, neither margin is  ignored. The layout of a parent component will always constrain any child components. As such, setting ignoreDocumentMargin to true for a component will have no effect if it is inside of a container with ignoreDocumentMargin set to false.Specifying a value other than none for ignoreViewportPadding will take precedence over any value defined for ignoreDocumentMargin.On a device with screen size wider than the document width and margin combined, a component with ignoreDocumentMargin property set to true will extend the width of the document plus the margin, but will not extend into the viewport padding."

Padding, if any, on both sides is ignored.Instead of specifying padding, you can set this property to true to indicate that paddings on both sides should be ignored, or set it to false to ignore neither padding.

Setting ignoreViewportPadding to true for a component will have no effect if it is inside of a container with ignoreViewportPadding set to false.If ignoreViewportPadding is set to true, left, right, or both it overrides the layout’s ignoreDocumentMargin value and spans the entire screen.If ignoreViewportPadding is set to none, the value of ignoreDocumentMargin is accepted. By default, components do not ignore the viewport padding, even if you previously specified ignoreDocumentMargin to span the entire width of the screen. To achieve the same functionality, you must update your article to use ignoreViewportPadding."

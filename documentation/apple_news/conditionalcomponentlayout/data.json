Right padding is ignored.both. Padding, if any, on both sides is ignored.Instead of specifying padding, you can set this property to true to indicate that paddings on both sides should be ignored, or set it to false to ignore neither padding. By default, neither padding is ignored.The layout of a parent component will always constrain any child components. Setting ignoreViewportPadding to true for a component will have no effect if it is inside of a container with ignoreViewportPadding set to false.If ignoreViewportPadding is set to true, left, right, or both it overrides the layout’s ignoreDocumentMargin value and spans the entire screen.If ignoreViewportPadding is set to none, the value of ignoreDocumentMargin is accepted. By default, components do not ignore the viewport padding, even if you previously specified ignoreDocumentMargin to span the entire width of the screen. To achieve the same functionality, you must update your article to use ignoreViewportPadding."

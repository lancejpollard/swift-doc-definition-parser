  "desc": "A segment is selected only when the user is pressing the mouse down within the bounds of the segment. When the mouse is no longer down within the segment, the segment is automatically deselected. A momentary segmented control sends an action when the user clicks a segment, and another action when the user releases the segment. If configured as continuous (see isContinuous), the control also sends actions at repeating intervals until the user releases the segment, at which point the control sends its final action.",

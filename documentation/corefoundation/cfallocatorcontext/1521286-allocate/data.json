  "desc": "A prototype for a function callback that allocates memory of a requested size. In implementing this function, allocate a block of memory of at least size bytes and return a pointer to the start of the block. The hint argument is a bitfield that you should currently not use (that is, assign 0). The size parameter should always be greater than 0. If it is not, or if problems in allocation occur, return NULL. This function pointer may not be assigned NULL.",

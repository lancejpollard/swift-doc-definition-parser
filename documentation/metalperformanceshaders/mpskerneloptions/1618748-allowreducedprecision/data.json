  "desc": "When possible, kernels use a higher-precision data representation internally than the destination storage format to avoid excessive accumulation of computational rounding error in the result. This option advises the kernel that the destination storage format already has too much precision for what is ultimately required downstream, and the kernel may use reduced precision internally when it determines that a less precise result would yield better performance. When enabled, the performance win is often small and the precision of the result may vary by hardware and OS.",

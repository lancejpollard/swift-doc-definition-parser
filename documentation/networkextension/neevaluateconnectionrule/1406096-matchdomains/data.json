If the destination hostname of a connection matches any of the domains in the array, then the connection matches the rule. Each domain is matched against the destination hostname using suffix matching, and each label in the domain must match an entire label in the hostname. For example, the domain example.com will match the hostname www.example.com but not www.anotherexample.com.",
